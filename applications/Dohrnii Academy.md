### Overview

Blockchain is a booming technology, and many people would like to be part of it, but they fear it as it looks complex from the outside. We would like to provide a solution for creating an Academy on VeChain which will make blockchain understanding easy and engaging, gamifying it. That will allow more people to understand and to start using blockchain, especially VeChain, as we will use the Dohrnii token to reward the users when they successfully complete tests and challenges.
The main goal of this project is to educate more people and bring them to blockchain. In addition to crypto education the application contains lessons on economics and financial topics as well. 

Here are some screenshots of the application and the design mockup we already have:

### Project Details

The project will have 3 main milestones:

1) Development - The application for IOS and Android will be developed using Xamarin Forms. For the API, we will use Python Django.

2) Testing - We will run multiple tests to ensure all the functionalities are working.

3) Adding challenges and NFTs - Adding new games so people can play by using the Dohrnii token.

### Ecosystem Fit

The Academy will be a great introduction to new people on the blockchain. Academy users will be rewarded with Dohrnii tokens, a token that runs on VeChain. We will also integrate the fee delegation to make it easier for the users to make transactions. Our users that mostly consist of people that are not yet familiar with crypto won't be intimidated this way.

### Team's experience

The SayNode Operations team has already implemented several projects for the company, including for VeChain. Besides the token migration of Dohrnii Operations https://dohrnii.io/ from Ethereum to VeChain, a first project directly for Vechain has already been implemented. Further, a grant has already been awarded by VeChain for the Dev-Thorkit-Dart see here: https://github.com/vechain/grant-program/pull/51, the implementation of the project is still ongoing. Besides, a first Flutter App was developed, which was accepted by the Apple Store as well as the Android Store and can be found here: https://github.com/SayNode/342.

Renato Schär and Werner Liechti are CTO of Dohrnii Operations and CEO and COO of SayNode Operations. The Dohrnii project is a DAO solution with a native token DHN on Ethereum, VeChain and Binance. The technical implementation of the Dohrnii project is mainly done by SayNode Operations (https://dohrnii.io/). Both have a computer science background and a degree from a Swiss university. They are also part of the new Draper University and VeChain Fellowship program with a new Product Vidaia (not live yet), which is also developed on VeChain

Yann Marti is a Flutter Developer at SayNode Operations. He is an absolute specialist and does all frontend work for the Vidaia app as well as for Dohrnii. Likewise, he created the frontend for the already existing app (https://github.com/SayNode/342). For the already guaranteed grant of VeChain he also takes over a large part of the development. He is also studying Computer Science at the University of Bern. 

Paula and João are blockchain developers and have contributed heavily to the implementation of Dohrnii. They are and have also both been involved in SayNode Operations' other projects. Paula has a Bachelor's degree in IT Security and a Master's degree in Cryptography, Data Security and Blockchain and previous work experience. João has a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and has worked as a Software Developer at Siemens Logistics. From May, Paula and João were joined by Riccardo Mazzucchelli who also has a background as a developer and had his own company in the crypto field. 

Francesco Romeo is a FullStack Developer and has a university degree in Computer Engineering. He has several years of experience as a developer in different companies and accompanied as CTO and Founder the startup Buytime. The last years he worked as a FullStack Developer at the University of Applied Sciences in Bern. 

Simon Heer has worked several years in B2B Sales for RedHat and VmWare as well as in IT Risk and Compliance at AXA Insurance. He has a Master in Digital Business and Innovation and is responsible for the business aspects of the products.

#### Community engagement

For the community engagement, we will operate different channels simultaneously to achieve the widest possible reach. 

SayNode Channels: We will use our own channels to advertise. For this, a blog post will be made in collaboration with a freelancer for our website and blog. Then a post will also be made for LinkedIn. We will also regularly inform about the solution and its progress via Twitter. 

External Channels: In order to achieve the widest possible reach, we will use Medium. For this we will write an article at the respective milestones. We will also make all posts directly available to VeChain, so that they can be used on your side if necessary. In addition, we will participate in possible events to draw attention to us.

Dohrnii Channel: Using the Dohrnii channel which consists of a Discord, Telegram chat and an Instagram account, reaching to an audience of up to 10000 people.

## Future Plans

We are planning to educate our users so in the future they would be able to correctly and wisely use our next product, a marketplace, where they can buy and sell products and datasets. An example can be trading dataset that analyze the market using the Dohrnii tokens they have earned from the app.
Another plan is to introduce this application in schools to teach the new generations about finance and blockchain.
