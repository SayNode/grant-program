### Overview

We would like to provide a solution for VeChain similar to what Infura has already developed for Ethereum. SayNode Operations has already launched several projects on VeChain and has used Truffle for deployment. Currently, Truffle is still the most widely used suite and provides a world-class development environment, alongside a testing framework and an asset pipeline for projects using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Paired with Ganache, a personal blockchain, and Drizzle, a front-end dApp development kit, the full Truffle suite of tools promises to be an end-to-end dApp development platform.

The SayNode Operations team has also used Truffle for their already implemented projects on VeChain. Unfortunately, the integration of VeChain is sometimes cumbersome with Web3-gear and a hurdle for developers to overcome. With this project we want to remove this obstacle by providing a similar solution as Infura for VeChain. For this we will host our own node and web3-gear will be managed by our system. We will create a website with dashboards and all the necessary tools (similar to infura) where developers can sign up and we will generate a link for them. With this link the users will be able to seamlessly integrate VeChain and directly use Truffle. We will then take care of the request and response. That way we provide a smooth and easy solution for developers to combine Truffle and VeChain.  

The overaching goal of this project is to build a solution that developers are used to and eliminate the existing hurdle.


### Project Details

We have divided the project into three sub-steps. 

Receive requests and transform them (RPC to RESTful conversion)
Backend user management, issuing API keys
Frontend (website, keys, dashboard, statistics page, etc)

The individual milestones and their duration can be viewed in detail below. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Developers who want to interact with VeChain need most likely to use Web3-gear, which means an additional effort in order to use VeChain compared to other EVM based chains. We want to eliminate this barrier and give developers an easy way to program for VeChain through a solution they most likely already know from other projects. We are taking on a role similar to what Infura is doing for Ethereum and hope to provide a solution to developers with the new capabilities that will ultimately grow the entire VeChain ecosystem.

### Team's experience

The SayNode Operations team has already implemented several projects for the company, including for VeChain. Besides the token migration of Dohrnii Foundation https://dohrnii.io/ from Ethereum to VeChain, a first project directly for VeChain has already been implemented. Further, a grant has already been awarded by VeChain for the Dev-Thorkit-Dart see here: https://github.com/VeChain/grant-program/pull/51. Besides, a first Flutter App was developed, which was accepted by the Apple Store as well as the Android Store and can be found here: https://github.com/SayNode/342.

Renato Schär and Werner Liechti are CTOs of the Dohrnii Foundation and CEO and COO of SayNode Operations. The Dohrnii project is a DAO solution with a native token DHN on Ethereum, VeChain and Binance. The technical implementation of the Dohrnii project is mainly done by SayNode Operations (https://dohrnii.io/). Both have a computer science background and a degree from a Swiss university. They are also part of the new Draper University and VeChain Fellowship program with a new product called Vidaia (not live yet), which is also developed on VeChain and currently contesting in the Hackathon.

Yann Marti is a Flutter Developer at SayNode Opeartions. He is an absolute specialist and does all frontend work for the Vidaia app as well as for Dohrnii. Likewise, he created the frontend for the already existing app (https://github.com/SayNode/342). For the already guaranteed grant of VeChain he also takes over a large part of the development. He is also studying Computer Science at the University of Bern. 

Paula and João are blockchain developers and have contributed heavily to the implementation of Dohrnii. They are and have also both been involved in SayNode Opearations' other projects. Paula has a Bachelor's degree in IT Security and a Master's degree in Cryptography, Data Security and Blockchain and previous work experience. João has a Master's degree in Electical and Computer Engineering and has worked as a Software Developer at Siemens Logistics. From May, Paula and João were joined by Riccardo Mazzucchelli who also has a background as a developer and had his own company in the crypto field. 

Francesco Romeo is a FullStack Developer and has a university degree in Computer Engineering. He has several years of experience as a developer in different companies and accompanied as CTO and Founder the startup Buytime. The last years he worked as a FullStack Developer at the University of Applied Sciences in Bern. 

Simon Heer has worked several years in B2B Sales for RedHat and VmWare as well as in IT Risk and Compliance at AXA Insurance. He has a Master in Digital Business and Innovation and is responsible for the business aspects of the products.

Also, SayNode Operations channels will be used to inform the community. Specifically, a blog post will be written on the website and a post will be made on LinkedIn. Also a documentation will be created that gives information about the handling and functionalities. 

For the final product, SayNode Operations will either create the projects own website or integrate it with its own subpage in the already existing SayNode Operations website. 

## Future Plans

We will be able to create a first solution with this grant application. We will expand this in a second step and plan to host it globally in the V2 of it. A second grant application will be created to cover operating costs in the starting phase of the project and in order to improve upon its functionalities.

## Additional Information 

- What work has been done so far?

The planning of the project is mostly done and many of the subcomponents in order to build it already exist. The missing part for a succesful launch is the integration of the different systems in a user friendly way. 

- Are there any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?

The project has not received any direct investment from other resources and is managed solely by SayNode Operations. 

- Have you applied for other grants so far?
No grant has yet been requested for this specific project. A grant has already been approved for a VeChain project with a different use case as mentioned above, see https://github.com/VeChain/grant-program/pull/51
